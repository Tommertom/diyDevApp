# diyDevApp - the alternative DevApp for (Ionic) devs - make you rown
This near-finished boilerplate allows you to run a devapp to test cordova web apps like Ionic's great framework on a physical device while runing a dev web server (like Ionic's `ionic serve`) and not needing to use a cable or live-reload.

Big difference with PhoneGaps's DevApp and Ionic's DevApp is that it doesn't have a fancy UI and and you can't tap three fingers to kill, but it does discovery, you can add your own plugins and you can do chrome developer inspections. Which I believe is more essential then anything else.

It remembers the last used servers, you can easily manually add servers yourself.

## How to use:
* `git clone https://github.com/Tommertom/diyDevApp.git`
* cd diyDevApp
* run `npm i`
* change `config.xml` to change the package name (optional)
* add the platform you want to use (ios/android)
* add the plugins you want to use - (the `cordova add plugin` command should suffice, btw)
* and install the custom diyDevApp build on the device (or multiple devices) using e.g. `ionic cordova run android`

If need to cordova plugins you want to use, just do the  `ionic cordova plugin add` part to add it to the diyDevApp boilerplate. And of course, in the app you are developing you need to both `ionic cordova plugin add` and the `npm install ` thing.

Security: this app uses cordova whitelist plugin v7 and allows you to access ANY webapp/website on the internet to be loaded in the webview container with the cordova plugins enabled. So basically extremely insecure if used improperly.

## How does it work?
The app does its magic through the following components:
* Use whitelist plugin to allow cross origin redirects. https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-plugin-whitelist/
* Use remote injection plugin to inject cordova.js asset (as ionic serve does not serve full cordova.js assets). https://github.com/TruckMovers/cordova-plugin-remote-injection
* Use simple `window.location` to redirect
* Use UDP to discover

That is all!

## Want to try a client
Here is a test client, but maybe better to check your own project.

## WARNIG: Few plugins included and tested
I tested this against, flashlight, device and vibration. And it works.

## Todo
Well, ideally, there would be a nice UI like Ionic's DevApp. Test a bit more plugins. Remove typos.

Tested under Android (I don't have xcode) and Samsung Tablet.
